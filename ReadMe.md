#Poker Probability Calculator

It is based on the variant Texas Hold 'em, and if you are unfamiliar with the rules go to the Rules Of Texas Hold 'em 
file. I'd suggest breifly reading it anyway just to refresh youself on the terms of poker, as well as learning my terms
(I believe I primarily used the common terms but just to double check)

##How It Works

As of now, this project randomly deals a chosen amount of players cards, then calculate the probability of
that starting hand ending with different hands. In the future I want to implement a setting to select cards, 
and a setting to swap between players to see all of their odds of different hands. 

Each package has it's own ReadMe further explaining that packages use in the program.

##Probability Mathematics
The math behind all the probability calculations can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1szqOczJywvRkg0WPcQOf7wx_OYCvQWnpwpCjL35v0sE/edit?usp=sharing). After any line of code with a probability, 
is a name and number, which you lookup in the document. So for Flush - 1, click Flush 1 on the side bar and 
it will bring you to a detailed explanation.
